Explanation of RSA vs. AES Differences

1.  **Cryptography Type:**
    * **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):** This is an **asymmetric** algorithm. It uses a key pair: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
    * **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** This is a **symmetric** algorithm. It uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption.

2.  **Performance & Speed:**
    * **RSA:** It is very **slow** and computationally expensive due to the complex mathematics (factoring large prime numbers).
    * **AES:** It is extremely **fast** and efficient, designed for high-speed hardware and software implementation.

3.  **Primary Use Case:**
    * **RSA:** Because it's slow, it is **not** used for bulk data encryption. Its main use is for **secure key exchange** (like in the TLS handshake, to encrypt a symmetric key) and **digital signatures**.
    * **AES:** Because it's fast, it is the standard for **bulk data encryption**. This includes encrypting files on your disk (FileVault, BitLocker), messages in your chats, and the data in your HTTPS connection *after* the handshake is complete.

In summary: RSA is for *authenticating* and *exchanging keys* (a slow, one-time setup), while AES is for *encrypting the actual data* (a fast, ongoing process).
